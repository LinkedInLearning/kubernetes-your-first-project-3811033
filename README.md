# Kubernetes: Your First Project

This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `kubernetes-your-first-project`.

The full course is available from [LinkedIn
Learning][lil-course-url].

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use
the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look
at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go
to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The
naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`.

As an example, the branch named `02_03`
corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.  Some
branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the
letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code
as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it
is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code
when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
